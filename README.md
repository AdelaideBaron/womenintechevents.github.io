## About Me & My Background

I've missed many events or opportunities just because I didn‚Äôt check the right page or speak to the right people. There are so many accessible opportunities nowadays, and having them all in one place would really help.

### Me

- I'm **Adelaide**, and I am a **backend software engineer**!
- Those of you who know me, know that I **hate frontend development**, so that‚Äôs why this page is nice and basic! üòÖ

## Local Development

I recommend the following extensions:

- Live Server by Ritwick Dey
- Prettier - Code formatter by Prettier
