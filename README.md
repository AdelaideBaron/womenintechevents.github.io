## ✨ Submitting an Event or Course

We now use **Google Forms** to collect new events and learning opportunities.  
**Manual submissions via GitHub are no longer supported.**

- 👉 [Submit an event](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ddbjShFsWmDSXdW9e_uVGQllfLwNbXxrRkOkH818sa8/viewform)
- 👉 [Submit a course or learning opportunity](https://forms.gle/5NernY5jdfXjhpaFA)

All submissions are reviewed and automatically published once approved.  
Thank you for contributing to the community! 💛

## 🔄 How This Page Updates

This site uses a GitHub Action to pull new events and courses submitted through Google Forms every day at midnight UTC.

Scripts are located in the `/cloud_integration` directory and handle:

- Fetching data from Google Sheets
- Appending valid entries to `events.json` and `courses.json`
- Committing updates to this repo

If you're curious about how it works, check the [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/update.yml).
