        <h2>👩‍💻 About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a <strong>Lead Instructor in Software Engineering</strong>,
          specialising in <strong>Python, SQL, Java</strong>, and
          <strong>AI/ML</strong>. I've been teaching for over 3 years, teaching
          almost 2000 women to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started with a degree in Mathematics — during my final project, I
          had to learn to code and completely caught the tech bug. Since then,
          I’ve been passionate about technology and empowering others through
          it.

        <h2>🌸 Why I Started This Page</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Women in Tech</strong> community has been pivotal for my
          career. Every time I catch up with friends in tech, someone mentions
          an event or opportunity they found through a niche page or word of
          mouth — and I’ll be gutted that I missed it!
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m hoping this page can help us
          <strong
            >collate all the incredible events we come across and make them
            visible to everyone</strong
          >.
